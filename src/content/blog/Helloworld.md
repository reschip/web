I’m Chip Huyen, a writer and computer scientist. I grew up chasing grasshoppers in a small rice-farming village in Vietnam.

My focus is on ML/AI systems in production. I’m currently exploring creative use cases of AI in education and entertainment.

Previously, I worked on ML tooling at NVIDIA (core dev of NeMo), Snorkel AI, and Netflix. I also founded and sold an AI infra startup.

Running a startup taught me that being a founder is incredibly hard, so I try to support founders in any way I can. Some startups I’ve worked with included Convai, OctoAI, and Photoroom.

I graduated from Stanford, where I taught ML Systems. The lectures became the foundation for the book Designing Machine Learning Systems, which is an Amazon #1 bestseller in AI and has been translated into 10+ languages (very proud)!

My new book AI Engineering (2025) is currently the most read book on the O’Reilly platform. It’s also available on Amazon and Kindle.

I’m active on GitHub and aspire to become a Goodreads influencer. You can also find me on Google Scholar. I frequently speak at and occasionally host events.

I enjoy learning about fun technical challenges and collaborating with great teams. Reach out if you want to find a way to work together!
